# Projects
Projects, a lot of good ones, hopefully

I create this repository today in hopes of filling it with numerous projects, projects that I make at the very least over the course of the next year, and perhaps many years to come. Hopefully, this repository will be a showcase for all the skills I acquire or already possess, albeit meager. I plan on having at least one decent project for each; C++, Java and Python. I also hope to find time to learn rust and do something in it, and build a web application or two along the way. Anyways, fingers crossed and lets hope for the best.
